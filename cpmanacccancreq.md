# Managing cancellation requests
{: #customerportal_acccancreq}

If you are the master user of an account or have administrative access to it, you can view cancellations and cancellation tickets and you can also void pending cancellations.
{:shortdesc}


You manage cancellations at any time from the Cancellation Requests window. The Cancellation Requests window displays all completed and pending cancellations associated with an account. From this window, you can view cancellations and associated tickets. If a service or solution hasn't been canceled yet, the cancellation might be voided. Use the following steps to access the Cancellation Requests window.

1. Access the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account > Sales > Cancellations** from the menu to access the Cancellation Requests window.

If a service or solution has already been canceled, the "void cancellation" option is not shown.
